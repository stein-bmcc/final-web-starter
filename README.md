# Final Web Project Starter Template
This repository is used to give you a start to your final that is a web site. 

1. **index.html** is the home page
    1. **DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME** of this file. On a web site the home page must always be index.html.

## Instructions

For this you will edit index.html and upload your video to the media folder.

To use this template you will need to:

1. Upload your images to the **images** folder.
2. On your video and audio files to the **media** folder.
3. Create .html files for all of your pages. You should know what you need from your site map.
    1. Don't put spaces in the name. YES: `myfile.html`, NO: `my file name.html`
    2. Use dashes or underscores instead of spaces. YES: `my_file.html`, NO: `my file.html`
    3. Don't start with capital letters. YES: `myfile.html`, NO: `Myfile.html`
4. Update the `<header>` element in index.html to have a site title and your navigation. You can copy an example in our class site: HTML Snippets > Navigation.
5. Edit the **href** attributes in each of your links to point to the pages that you made in step 3. 
4. Test out your navigation.
5. If you are using a footer, add content to the footer. Delete if if you are not going to use a footer.
6. Use an h1 element to add a page title.
7. Copy the entire index.html page (all of the lines)
8. Paste it into each page and after you do, change the page title in the h1 to match the page.
9. Double-check that the navigation is working.
10. Add in your page content for each page.

### example.html

This page has examples of adding in various media:

* Images
* Audio
* Video File
* Video from YouTube

You can copy and paste examples from this to use in your pages.

### style.css

A lot of selectors have already been added to this file to help you get started and organize your CSS file.

* **Typography**
    * If you're using Google Fonts, paste in your @import code in line 1
    * set your default font-family, line-height inside the **body** selector
    * set your font-family for your headings in the **h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6** selector. This is a list of all heading selectors. You can delete some of them if you don't want your style to apply to all headings.
* **Hyperlinks**: there is a special section with some example hyperlink styles. You can change these colors and anything else you like.
    * Note that the navigation also has links so the link styling there is repeated. You can style them the same or differently than other links on your page.
* **Navgation** There are some started navigation styles that turn an unordered list into a horizontal navigation menu.
* **Media** Some basic styles for media
    * img and video elements so they are responsive
    * Styling for an embedded YouTube video. This only works if you also have the HTML elements shown in example.html.
